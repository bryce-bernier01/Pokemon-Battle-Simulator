# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
This is a school project I'd like to keep working on based on the battling system in Pokemon Games. Written in Java and uses GUI packages that are default for Java. It is buggy and I have a lot to add before I'm happy with it. I'd say 60% of the way done. Feel free to look around and/or use snippets of code.

Things I'd like to add:
1) .gifs to give animations to moves
2) Health bars
3) Enemy AI, currently just chooses same move slot the player chooses.
4) Remove a lot of bugs i.e. some moves not doing damage.
5) More moves and/or pokemon. This is a very strong maybe. May need to switch over to a database for this.
